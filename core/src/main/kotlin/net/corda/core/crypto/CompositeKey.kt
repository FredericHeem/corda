/**
 * A tree data structure that enables the representation of composite public keys.
 * Notice that with that implementation CompositeKey extends PublicKey. Leaves are represented by single public keys.
 *
 * For complex scenarios, such as *"Both Alice and Bob need to sign to consume a state S"*, we can represent
 * the requirement by creating a tree with a root [CompositeKey], and Alice and Bob as children.
 * The root node would specify *weights* for each of its children and a *threshold* – the minimum total weight required
 * (e.g. the minimum number of child signatures required) to satisfy the tree signature requirement.
 *
 * Using these constructs we can express e.g. 1 of N (OR) or N of N (AND) signature requirements. By nesting we can
 * create multi-level requirements such as *"either the CEO or 3 of 5 of his assistants need to sign"*.
 *
 * [CompositeKey] maintains a list of [NodeAndWeight]s which holds child subtree with associated weight carried by child node signatures.
 *
 * The [threshold] specifies the minimum total weight required (in the simple case – the minimum number of child
 * signatures required) to satisfy the sub-tree rooted at this node.
